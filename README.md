# Project Title: Data Analytics Power BI Reporting Project

## Project Overview

A medium-sized international retailer must take their BI practices to the next level.  They have a large amount of sales data from multiple sources over several years. 

The retailer must transform the data into actionable insights to support improved decision-making.  The objective is to use Power BI to design and develop a comprehensive quarterly report.  This will involve extracting and transforming data from various origins, designing a robust data model rooted in a star-based schema, and then constructing a multi-page report.

The report will present a high-level business summary tailored for C-suite executives, and also give insights into their highest value customers segmented by sales region, provide a detailed analysis of top-performing products categorised by type against their sales targets, and a visually appealing map visual that spotlights the performance metrics of their retail outlets across different territories.

## Milestone 1:

Configuration of the GitHub environment for this project

## Milestone 2: Importing Data into PowerBI

This stage focused on data loading and preparation.  As mentioned, data is being sourced from multiple locations.  This required data to be loaded from:
- Azure SQL database (Orders table)
- Azure Blob storage account (Stores table)
- Web-hosted CSV files (Products table)
- ZIP file containing multiple CSV files (Customers table, created from a combination of three CSV files)
